| Feature                           | **Parcel**                             | **Vite**                               | **CRA (Create React App)**     |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🔧 **Configuration**              | Zero-config                            | Minimal config                         | Zero-config                    |
| 🚀 **Startup Speed**              | Fast (but slower than Vite)            | Extremely fast (native ESM, optimized) | Slower (uses Webpack)          |
| ⚙️ **Bundler**                    | Built-in bundler                       | Uses Rollup internally                 | Uses Webpack                   |
| 🔄 **HMR (Hot Module Reloading)** | Works, but slower than Vite            | Very fast                              | Slower                         |
| 📦 **Tree-shaking**               | Yes                                    | Yes                                    | Yes                            |
| 📁 **File Type Support**          | Wide range (JS, TS, CSS, Images, etc.) | Wide, but extensible                   | Moderate                       |
| 📜 **TypeScript Support**         | Built-in (needs config)                | Built-in (very smooth)                 | Supported, but heavier setup   |
| 🧠 **Learning Curve**             | Very beginner-friendly                 | Easy, but assumes module knowledge     | Beginner-friendly              |
| ⚡️ **Performance**                | Good, but depends on project size      | Excellent                              | Lower in large apps            |
| 📦 **Package Size (build)**       | Small to moderate                      | Very small and optimized               | Larger compared to Parcel/Vite |
| 💻 **Dev Experience**             | Clean, modern error reporting          | Best-in-class error overlay            | Decent, but verbose            |
